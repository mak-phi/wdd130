    <h2>Roy Makau</h2>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I am a husband, a father of two wonderful boys and a member of the Church from Nairobi, Kenya. I am currently out of work but I have professional experience in accounting and logistics coordination. My true passion, however, is in tech and how information can solve people's problems. This started back in the late 90's watching my brother (that's him in the picture) play "Raptor", "Prince" (the 2D version) or "Heretic" while I looked over his shoulder acting as his unofficial navigator/clue finder :P. We'd get lost inside games for hours... those were happy times!</p>
    <p>Most of the things I know about computers, I've learned it from my brother. I wish I pursued my love for technology as a career but back then programming wasn't a real career choice and I thought I'd make more money if I studied finance and buy my mom her dream house. Well things didn't go as planned but I'm glad I'm here now, pursuing my Bsc degree in Software Development and I'm glad to be taking this course with you.</p>
