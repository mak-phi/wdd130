                </div>
                <p>Through art, literature and music, our students learn to think critically, to empathize with others and to express themselves in creative ways.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Students get to strengthen both their bodies and minds while still having fun by learning team-work, psychology, strategy and at the same time developing respect, self-discipline, their self-esteem, determination and grit.</p>

                <p>Math is a universal language. By studying mathematics, our students are able to appreciate and communicate the secrets of the universe in a logical manner.</p>

                </div>
                <p>At Hera, we encourage our students to be fiercely curious about their natural environment, to apply the scientific process to discover the laws that govern nature for themselves.  It is our hope that our students will experience the joys and satisfaction of knowing (or pursuing knowledge of) “how stuff works”, how everything is interconnected and how this reflects upon their own existence.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We nurture creativity and self-confidence in our students by teaching them problem-solving and practical programming skills (languages) and encouraging them to collaborate and apply these skills to invent and manipulate systems and data to solve everyday problems within their environment.</p>
