                    <p>Admittedly, there is a lot we do not understand about everything but our spirit of learning is driven by knowing what to do when you don't know what to do. For us that means first, accepting what you don't know and second, applying the scientific method of observation (measuring), prediction modelling, experimentation, observation (measuring) and objective analysis of the model repeating until the truth reveals itself. This is often an exercise of faith and requires humility, objectivity, hard work, perseverance, determination and grit. All values that we hope to cultivate in our learners along with a growth mindset.  The belief that anyone can improve their intelligence, skills and talents through practice (iteration), perseverance, embracing challenges and viewing failure and positive criticism as an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

                        We believe that learning never ends and we encourage our learners to apply the same approach in all aspects of their lives be it in taking a free-kick, to studying the immune response of tomato plant to playing the guitar, to understanding what happens to your brain when you spend too much time on social media, to writing code to determine the fastest route for an ambulance to take based on current traffic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We encourage our learners to be creative and curious, that is, to connect what they already know, to formulate hypotheses, and to actively test what they have learned in a safe way so as to promote long-term understanding.</p>
                    <p>
                        We believe in sharing knowledge and we express this by encouraging our learners to teach one another, their friends, families and the world what they discover in their quest to understand these universal truths.

                        The problem, as Randolph has realized, is that the best way for a young person to build character is for him to attempt something where there is a real and serious possibility of failure. In a high-risk endeavour, whether it's in business or athletics or the arts, you are more likely to experience colossal defeat than in a low-risk one—but you're also more likely to achieve real and original success. “The idea of building grit and building self-control is that you get that through failure,” Randolph explained.
