      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To establish an official site for our target customers to access information about the school's organization, curriculum, facilities & extra-curricular activities offered; view general announcements, FAQs, and location & contact information, especially for parents and/or guardians who desire a credible source of information about the school.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p>To direct traffic to our social media platforms where our main advertising campaign will be carried out.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p>To help communicate and support the school's overall brand i.e., "A school that forsters curiosity and promotes discovery of knowledge by learners through application of the scientific method in all fields of learning".</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our primary target customer group is households comprised of middle-income, open-minded parents/guardians between the ages of 25 to 50 years, where at least one parent/guardian has full-time employment and leads a busy life but still values quality education and appreciates the importance of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills (such as grit & perseverence) towards the success of their children. Such parents should be active and willing to devote additional resources (information, time etc.) towards their children's learning. They should also show a desire to form a community with other parents/guardians to continuously improve the school for the benefit of the learners.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>Knowledge is Power, but Truth is Freedom</p>
      <p>
        Hera School of Gifted Children offers a science-based curriculum that equips learners with the necessary skills to seek the truth and apply the knowledge they discover to change the world for the better.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
      <p>
        In an age where truth is 'relative' and, if the studies are to be believed, where a lie travels six times faster than the truth, we here at Hera School of Gifted Children believe in absolute truths. Universal laws that govern not just our lives, but everything within the known universe. We believe in seeking these principles of truth, in understanding ourselves and each other and how and why the universe works. We believe that knowing the truth will indeed set us free as individuals and as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
        "A man of science rises ever, in seeking truth; and if he never finds it in its wholeness, he discovers nevertheless very significant fragments; and these fragments of universal truth are precisely what constitutes science." ― Claude Bernard</p>
      <p>
        "Without seeking, truth cannot be known at all. It can neither be declared from pulpits, nor set down in articles, nor in any wise prepared and sold in packages ready for use. Truth must be ground for every man by itself out of it such, with such help as he can get, indeed, but not without stern labor of his own." ― John Ruskin
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am going and I don't know where I am going. I leave you searching for answers. When I get there, if there is any way to come back either spiritually or physically or through a revelation, I will let you know what I have experienced. Of course some will not believe me or the one I send” ― Bangambiki Habyarimana, Pearls Of Eternity
      </p>
      <p>"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" ― John 8:32</p>

      <h3>Learning Approach</h3>
      <h4>How We Teach, How We Learn: Discovering truths about our universe</h4>
      <p>
        Admittedly, there is a lot we do not understand about everything but our spirit of learning is driven by knowing what to do when you don't know what to do. For us that means first, accepting what you don't know and second, applying the scientific method of observation (measuring), prediction modelling, experimentation, observation (measuring) and objective analysis of the model repeating until the truth reveals itself. This is often an exercise of faith and requires humility, objectivity, hard work, perseverance, determination and grit. All values that we hope to cultivate in our learners along with a growth mindset.  The belief that anyone can improve their intelligence, skills and talents through practice (iteration), perseverance, embracing challenges and viewing failure and positive criticism as an opportunity to learn and grow. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that learning never ends and we encourage our learners to apply the same approach in all aspects of their lives be it in taking a free-kick, to studying the immune response of tomato plant to playing the guitar, to understanding what happens to your brain when you spend too much time on social media, to writing code to determine the fastest route for an ambulance to take based on current traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage our learners to be creative and curious, that is, to connect what they already know, to formulate hypotheses, and to actively test what they have learned in a safe way so as to promote long-term understanding. We 
        We believe in sharing knowledge and we express this by encouraging our learners to teach one another, their friends, families and the world what they discover in their quest to understand these universal truths.
      </p>

        “The problem, as Randolph has realized, is that the best way for a young person to build character is for him to attempt something where there is a real and serious possibility of failure. In a high-risk endeavour, whether it's in business or athletics or the arts, you are more likely to experience colossal defeat than in a low-risk one—but you're also more likely to achieve real and original success. “The idea of building grit and building self-control is that you get that through failure,” Randolph explained.” ― Paul Tough, How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character

      <h4>What We Use to Learn</h4>
      <p>“The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous.” ― Carl Sagan</p>
      <h4>Creative Arts & Literature</h4>

      <p>“Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.” ― Pablo Picasso</p>

      <p>Through art, literature and music, our students learn to think critically, to empathize with others and to express themselves in creative ways.</p>
      
      <p>Learn More</p>
      
      <h4>Games & Sports</h4>

      <p>“You are never really playing an opponent. You are playing yourself, your own highest standards, and when you reach your limits, that is real joy.” ― Arthur Ashe</p>

      <p>Students get to strengthen both their bodies and minds while still having fun by learning team-work, psychology, strategy and at the same time developing respect, self-discipline, their self-esteem, determination and grit.</p>
      
      <p>Learn More</p>
      
      <h4>Mathematics</h4>
      <p>“Go down deep enough into anything and you will find mathematics.” — Dean Schlicter</p>

      <p>“Without mathematics, there’s nothing you can do. Everything around you is mathematics. Everything around you is numbers.” — Shakuntala Devi, Indian writer and mental calculator</p>

      <p>Math is a universal language. By studying mathematics, our students are able to appreciate and communicate the secrets of the universe in a logical manner.</p>
      
      <p>Learn More</p>
      
      <h4>Natural Sciences</h4>
      
      <p>“The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.” ― Carl Sagan</p>

      <p>At Hera, we encourage our students to be fiercely curious about their natural environment, to apply the scientific process to discover the laws that govern nature for themselves.  It is our hope that our students will experience the joys and satisfaction of knowing (or pursuing knowledge of) “how stuff works”, how everything is interconnected and how this reflects upon their own existence.</p>

      <h4>Programming & Robotics</h4>

      <p>“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” ― George Bernard Shaw, Man and Superman</p>

      <p>We nurture creativity and self-confidence in our students by teaching them problem-solving and practical programming skills (languages) and encouraging them to collaborate and apply these skills to invent and manipulate systems and data to solve everyday problems within their environment.</p>
