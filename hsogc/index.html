                <h2>Knowledge is Power, but Truth is Freedom</h2>

                <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
                <p>In an age where truth is 'relative' and, if the studies are to be believed, where a lie travels six times faster than the truth, we here at Hera School of Gifted Children believe in absolute truths. Universal laws that govern not just our lives, but everything within the known universe. We believe in seeking these principles of truth, in understanding ourselves and each other and how and why the universe works. We believe that knowing the truth will indeed set us free as individuals and as a species.</p>

                    <p class="main-quote">A man of science rises ever, in seeking truth; and if he never finds it in its wholeness, he discovers nevertheless very significant fragments; and these fragments of universal truth are precisely what constitutes science.</p>

                <div id="seeking_quote">
                    <p class="main-quote">Without seeking, truth cannot be known at all. It can neither be declared from pulpits, nor set down in articles, nor in any wise prepared and sold in packages ready for use. Truth must be ground for every man by itself out of it such, with such help as he can get, indeed, but not without stern labor of his own.</p>

                    <p class="main-quote">I am going and I don't know where I am going. I leave you searching for answers. When I get there, if there is any way to come back either spiritually or physically or through a revelation, I will let you know what I have experienced. Of course some will not believe me or the one I send.</p>
